<h2> CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer</h2>
This is a CPU scheduling algorithms visualizer which gives the comparison between various scheduling algorithms through a graphical display.<br><br>
Total 7 scheduling algorithms have been implemented including the preemptive versions of some of the algorithms.<br><br>
Types of scheduling algorithms implemented:  

First come first serve- Schedules the processes according to their arrival time.

Shortest Job First- Processes with shorter burst time comes first .

Shortest Job First Preemptive- Regularly Updates the schedule, in which processes with shorter burst time comes first.

Longest Job First- Processes with larger burst time comes first.

Round Robin Scheduling- If the execution of the process is completed during the time-quantum then the process will end else the process will go back to the waiting table and wait for its next turn to complete the execution.

Priority- Processes with higher priority comes first. 

Priority Preemptive- Regularly Updates the schedule, in which processes with higher priority comes first.
